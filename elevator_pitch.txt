Elevator pitch:

My career in Call Center telephony has progressed from Cisco call center technologies to Amazon Connect and AWS cloud-based technologies. I have been responsible for migrating the Change Healthcare business units from Cisco technologies to Amazon Connect, migrating call flows, establishing SOP, and integrating third party applications such as Success KPI, Splunk, and Verint. I have been expanding my skill set to evolve into a new CI/CD DevOps model of deployment and management of the Call Center enterprise.

•	Expanding skillset: I have acquired the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate and Terraform Associate certifications.
•	Improved uptime: I created Lambda functions for monitoring that increased visibility to errors and resulted in less downtime.
•	Call Recording: I integrated Verint with AWS Connect enabling call recording and analysis of customer sentiment enabling increased customer satisfaction.
